# Traffic-Light-Optimisation-with-Machine-Learning
### Overview
Traffic in big cities can quickly become an issue and in today's times having people reset traffic timers is just not cutting it anymore. The idea involves creating a traffic optimisation system using machine learning, image processing and tracking to improve the flow of traffic at various times of day, under various kinds of conditions.
